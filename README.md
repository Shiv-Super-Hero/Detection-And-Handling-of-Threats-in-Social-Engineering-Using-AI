This project leverages machine learning (ML) models to identify phishing sites by analyzing URLs within a messaging application. By integrating trained ML models, the system performs real-time evaluations of links shared in messages, determining their legitimacy and safeguarding users from potential threats. Phishing attacks pose significant threats to users by tricking them into revealing sensitive information through deceptive websites. This project aims to mitigate such risks by implementing a system that detects phishing URLs in real-time within a messaging platform. Utilizing machine learning techniques, the system analyzes URL features to classify them as either legitimate or phishing attempts.â€‹The selected ML model is integrated into the messaging application to facilitate real-time URL analysis. Upon detecting a URL in a message, the system extracts its features and passes them to the ML model, which then classifies the URL as either legitimate or phishing. If identified as phishing, the system alerts the user and may block access to the URL to prevent potential harm. By implementing this system, we aim to enhance user security within messaging platforms by proactively detecting and mitigating phishing threats.
